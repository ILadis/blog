    <h1>How to use an existing save file with Goomba Color</h1>
    <p>Today I wanted to transfer my save file for Pokemon - Silver Edition from my PC to the EverDrive GBA X5 and continue my playthrough on my GameBoy Advance. I found out that the save file which was initially created on an emulator (namely <a href="https://mgba.io">mGBA</a>), is not compatible with the <a href="https://www.dwedit.org/gba/goombacolor.php">Goomba Color</a> emulator that I use on the GameBoy Advance.</p>
    <p>Fortunately there is a way to <em>convert</em> any raw save file to a Goomba Color compatible one.</p>
    <h2>Obtain an empty save file</h2>
    <p>First create a new save file with the Goomba Color emulator on your GameBoy Advance for the game you want to use.  After saving the game make sure to also press L+R to open the Goomba Color menu. By doing this the content of the save file is written to the SD card in your EverDrive.</p>
    <p>Power off the GameBoy Advance, insert the SD card into your computer and mount the appropriate device node for later use.</p>
    <h2>Convert the save file</h2>
    <p>There is a tool called <a href="https://github.com/libertyernie/goombasav">goombasav</a> which we will use to convert any existing save file to a Goomba Color compatible one.</p>
    <p>To do this, first clone the GitHub repository and then build the project:</p>
    <pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:libertyernie/goombasav.git
$ cd goombasav
$ make</code></pre>
    <p>After that use the <em>replace</em> operation of <em>goombasav</em> to inject any existing savefile you already have, into the Goomba Color save file you created earlier:</p>
    <pre><code>$ ./goombasav replace /sdcard/GBASYS/emusave/Pokemon*.srm ~/saves/Pokemon*.sav</pre></code>
    <p>Make sure to adjust the file paths accordingly.</p>
    <p>Now unmount the device, insert the SD card back into your EverDrive cartridge and check if the save file is working.</p>
